Write a blog about objects and its internal representation in Javascript

Objects are a fundamental data type in JavaScript, 
and you'll find them at the core of the language. 
They represent a collection of related data and functions, 
often referred to as properties and methods. In JavaScript, 
objects can be:

- Built-In Objects: These are provided by the JavaScript 
environment, like Date, Array, and Math.
- User-Defined Objects: You can create your own objects, 
defining their structure, properties, and methods.

const person = {
  name: "John",
  age: 30,
  hobbies: ["reading", "hiking"],
};

Internal representation

- Properties Table: Objects have an internal table that 
stores properties and their values.
- Hidden Classes (V8 Engine): The V8 JavaScript engine 
uses a concept called "hidden classes" to optimize property 
access. These hidden classes represent the structure of 
an object, helping the engine access properties more 
efficiently.
- Dictionaries (SpiderMonkey Engine): In contrast, 
engines like SpiderMonkey use dictionaries to store 
object properties. This makes it more flexible but 
potentially slower than hidden classes.
